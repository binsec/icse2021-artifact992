The main goal of the artifact is to support the experimental
claims of the paper #992 “Interface Compliance of Inline
Assembly: Automatically Check, Patch and Refine” by making
both the prototype and data available to the community. We
aim to obtain the badge Replicated as people will be able
to automatically replay our benchmark given the provided
material. The expected result is the same output as the figures
given in Table I and Table IV (appendix C) of the paper.
In addition, we hope the released snapshot of our prototype
is simple, documented and robust enough to have some uses
for people dealing with inline assembly.
